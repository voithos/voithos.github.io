## Hi there! I'm Zaven.

---

I'm a software developer living in the pleasant Seattle area with my
wonderful wife Daisy.


I find most things mathematical, scientific, or technological to be highly
interesting, but I am *particularly* fascinated (enthralled, even) by
computer science and programming. I enjoy learning about various such topics,
and building interesting things based on what I learn.

I use the name `"voithos"` on most sites. If you'd like, you can send me an

Thanks for reading, and have a nice day!
