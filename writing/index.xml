      <description>She started small.
At first, it was dark, with nothing more than a sensation of a cool breeze against her skin. She pulled her arms and legs close, as they were the only real things she could feel. Her world was silent and lonely, although she couldn’t yet know. Her awareness was yet a small bud.
After a time, she noticed a glint at the edge of her vision, a focused, mild glow from above.</description>

      <description>Emerick Reeve stood, arms crossed, near the entrance of the open-air bazaar. The merchant, a quivering, balding man in his forties, stared at him intently, a film of sweat glistening on his forehead.
“Tell me again, what was your price for the horse?” he said, unmoving. The merchant hesitated, eyed him up and down before briefly glancing at the woman standing nearby. She had a pouch of coin in hand, and was about to hand it all over before Emerick intervened.</description>

      <description>I woke up quietly. It was early and still dark, maybe cloudy, I couldn’t really tell. I began my morning routine, but it soon became clear that it was going to be one of those gradual mornings, where my brain would take a good 20 minutes to boot up, meaning that I’d only really regain consciousness somewhere between the shower and the sink. Why had I woken up so early? Ah, that’s right, it was project day, and I had wanted to get an early start on my novel.</description>

      <description>“Home is north.”
Ketil froze as the words materialized in his mind. They were hushed, easy to miss, but they had been coming regularly enough now that he had learned to pick them out. For months, he had been enduring these whispers and the pull they exerted on him. He could feel it: a draw, a kind of primal longing, no doubt from whatever was the source of the words.</description>

      <description>My eyes snapped open.
I struggled to distinguish any shape in front of me, looking up in the darkness of the room. I slowly pulled myself upright out of the glowing, neon blue pool I lay in. The cold water dripped down my face and off my hair, each droplet seeming to still hold a radiance of its own. I breathed out as my eyes adjusted to the darkness, seeing my breath materialize as a turbulent haze in front of me.</description>

      <description>I remember how that time began.
First, I saw light, as my mind coalesced from the void. The blurred lights in front of me solidified as my mind’s eye emerged, small, young, yet aware. An endless landscape spread out before me, reaching toward the horizon. I shifted my view without moving and beheld the world.
The sky was crimson red, glowing with a flame that marked the day’s passing. The radiance was rivaled only by the uncaring sands and rocks of the barren land below me.</description>
