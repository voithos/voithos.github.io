        <p>Hello! Здравствуйте! こんにちは！Unicode&nbsp;test!</p>

<p>If you can read that, then congratulations! Your <span class="caps">OS</span>/browser is not&nbsp;broken.</p>

<p>I finally took the plunge and created a blog. Here I hope to be able&nbsp;to
materialize and archive information on topics that I learn about or&nbsp;find
interest in, and perhaps even explore some original ideas of my own.&nbsp;Thus,
without further&nbsp;ado…</p>

<h2>Hello&nbsp;world!</h2>

<p>Phew.</p>

<p>Instead of diving into further introductory ceremony, I think it best to&nbsp;begin
with a reflection on what in all likelihood will be the core topic that I&nbsp;will
be writing&nbsp;about.</p>

<h1 id="computer-science"><a href="#computer-science">Computer&nbsp;Science</a></h1>

<p>Ah, yes. Computer science. The arcane art pursued by many a young and&nbsp;old
alike, and at the same time the most contemporary coolness permeating the&nbsp;world
of&nbsp;tech.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#History">beginnings of&nbsp;computer
science</a>, though, had&nbsp;a
slightly shifted focus. The days of startups, enterprise systems, and big&nbsp;data
were in the distant future. At the time, the areas of study were,&nbsp;naturally,
more fundamental. From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada
Lovelace</a>, who is credited&nbsp;with
writing the first algorithm designed for a computational machine, to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan
Turing</a>, a mathematician who&nbsp;defined
a hypothetical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Turing_machine">universal
computer</a> and used it&nbsp;to
prove certain properties about computability, early computer science&nbsp;was
explored largely from a mathematical perspective. As electronic computers&nbsp;began
to be manufactured, the practical applications of computer science&nbsp;became
increasingly relevant, and computer science as a field expanded to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#Areas_of_computer_science">multitude&nbsp;of
subdisciplines</a>.</p>

<p>Today, computer technology and software development have become integral&nbsp;parts
of society. Programming, besides conjuring up stereotypical images&nbsp;of
sunlight-deprived individuals sitting in front of a monitor hacking away on&nbsp;a
massive keyboard, has become an important industry profession. This&nbsp;has
naturally led to certain levels of specializations (e.g. web, system,&nbsp;graphics,
etc.) among most aspects of programming, including jobs, languages,&nbsp;and
tooling.</p>

<p>A consequence of this, though, is that it not all fields of programming&nbsp;require
deep knowledge of the classic fundamental aspects of computer science for&nbsp;day
to day&nbsp;work.</p>

<p><em>Well, we can’t have that, now, can&nbsp;we?</em></p>

<h1 id="areas-of-interest"><a href="#areas-of-interest">Areas of&nbsp;Interest</a></h1>

<p>The disciplines that make up computer science can be broadly classified&nbsp;as
either <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science">theoretical&nbsp;computer
science</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#Applied_computer_science">applied&nbsp;computer
science</a>.
As the name suggests, applied computer science includes topics and ideas&nbsp;that
can be directly used in practical contexts. Theoretical computer science,&nbsp;of
course, is often of interest to researchers. However, certain fields of study&nbsp;–
namely, algorithms and data structures – are highly useful, even&nbsp;considered
essential, for the reason that they define the fundamental primitives that&nbsp;most
industry professionals use on a daily&nbsp;basis.</p>

<p>And, of course, both forms of computer science are <em>extremely
interesting</em>.</p>

<p>The following is a listing (in no particular order) of a few of the&nbsp;disciplines
which constitute (in my opinion) the most interesting and useful parts&nbsp;of
computer science and&nbsp;programming.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">Algorithms</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structures"> and Data&nbsp;Structures</a></p>

    <p>Algorithms are the building blocks of computations. They are a&nbsp;logical,
  mechanical sequence of actions or evaluations that result in&nbsp;the
  calculation of some desired value. Data structures are the&nbsp;organizational
  blocks of data, designed with efficiency as the&nbsp;goal.</p>

    <p>Although both subjects can be studied independently, they are&nbsp;deeply
  related and are often grouped together. The book by Niklaus Wirth&nbsp;even
  declares:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_%2B_Data_Structures_%3D_Programs">Algorithms + Data Structures =&nbsp;Programs</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Most, if not all, other computer science disciplines make heavy use&nbsp;of
  complex algorithms and data structures and, thus, a solid&nbsp;understanding
  of algorithms and data structures is vital for deep endeavors into&nbsp;other
  areas of computer&nbsp;science.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">Cryptography</a></p>

    <p>Cryptography is the study of techniques used for secure communication&nbsp;and
  authentication. In the modern age of the Internet and anonymous&nbsp;peer-to-peer
  networks, cryptographic primitives are (or should be) used in virtually&nbsp;any
  kind of&nbsp;communication.</p>

    <p>A basic, well-rounded understanding of how to <em>use</em> known and&nbsp;proven
  cryptographic methods is extremely useful, particularly in&nbsp;any
  network-facing applications. However, the standard counsel on this&nbsp;subject
  is worth repeating: <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/18197/why-shouldnt-we-roll-our-own"><em>unless one is an expert, one should not attempt&nbsp;to
  create one’s own security scheme in a production system, as there are&nbsp;far
  too many crippling security mistakes that can&nbsp;be
  made</em></a>.</p>

    <p>Of course, if the goal is to learn – or just to have fun –&nbsp;then
  cryptography offers a myriad of interesting algorithms to&nbsp;explore.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory">Programming&nbsp;Languages</a></p>

    <p>The design of programming languages is a discipline which intimately&nbsp;blends
  theory and practice. The techniques and research of the field affect&nbsp;all
  software developers in the form of the compilers and interpreters that&nbsp;are
  used day to&nbsp;day.</p>

    <p>As programming languages are the primary tools for software&nbsp;developers,
  knowledge of their design and implementation – concepts like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory">type
  theory</a>,
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming">generics</a>,&nbsp;and
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming">metaprogramming</a> –&nbsp;can
  greatly aid in a developer’s ability to use their preferred&nbsp;languages
  skillfully.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence</a></p>

    <p>Likely the single broadest subfield in this list, artificial&nbsp;intelligence
  is the study and design of machines and programs which exhibit&nbsp;behaviors
  that akin to those of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent">intelligent
  agents</a>. This&nbsp;includes
  topics such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">machine
  learning</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural&nbsp;language
  processing</a>,
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision">computer vision</a>,&nbsp;and
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics">robotics</a>.</p>

    <p>Many forms of <span class="caps">AI</span> are heavily mathematical, but it is far from being just&nbsp;a
  theoretical field. In fact, <span class="caps">AI</span> is particularly prominent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_(video_games)">in&nbsp;video
  games</a>
  where it is used to construct the behaviors of non-player characters,&nbsp;among
  other&nbsp;things.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics_(computer_science)">Computer&nbsp;Graphics</a></p>

    <p>As it turns out, computer graphics are – surprise! – <em>also</em>&nbsp;highly
  prominent in video games. In&nbsp;particular,
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasterisation">rasterization</a> is&nbsp;currently
  the dominant approach used whenever interactivity is required.  In&nbsp;other
  contexts, different (generally slower) techniques, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)">ray
  tracing</a>, can be&nbsp;used
  to obtain extremely photorealistic&nbsp;images.</p>

    <p>Computer graphics relies on mathematics such as basic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra">linear
  algebra</a>, which is used&nbsp;to
  represent and transform geometry, as well as models of light&nbsp;propagation
  and diffusion, which is used for&nbsp;shading.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering">Software&nbsp;Engineering</a></p>

    <p>Although arguably not <em>quite</em> a form of engineering yet, a body&nbsp;of
  knowledge, through both research and industry practice, exists on&nbsp;the
  design, construction, and maintenance of computer programs.&nbsp;Collectively,
  these techniques are sometimes known as “software engineering,” and&nbsp;are
  <em>exceptionally</em> essential to professional programmers. In describing&nbsp;the
  driving goal for software engineering practices, Steve McConnell&nbsp;summarizes
  it as&nbsp;follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Managing complexity is the most important technical topic in&nbsp;software
development. In my view, it’s so important that Software’s&nbsp;Primary
Technical Imperative has to be <strong>managing complexity</strong>.</p>

      <p><cite><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Complete">Code Complete</a></em></cite></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The abstract nature of software poses few physical constraints on the&nbsp;size,
  interconnectivity, and information locality – in other words,&nbsp;the
  complexity – of software system.  Due to this, and <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/158640/why-cant-the-it-industry-deliver-large-faultless-projects-quickly-as-in-other">a variety of&nbsp;other
  factors</a>,
  software development is still difficult and many software&nbsp;engineering
  practices, although not a panacea, can help impose the limitations&nbsp;on
  complexity that are&nbsp;needed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="what-is-programming-then"><a href="#what-is-programming-then">What Is Programming,&nbsp;Then?</a></h1>

<p>As with any form of logical or creative work, computer science is not easy&nbsp;–
certainly, that is part of what makes it interesting. The wide variety&nbsp;of
subfields offer many avenues of exploration, and collectively have&nbsp;the
potential to provide value to virtually all industries and fields of study.&nbsp;On
the practical end sits the humble programmer, whose job it is to create&nbsp;this
value. So, <em>what is programming</em>,&nbsp;then?</p>

<p><strong>Programming is the act of, and the discipline associated with, taking&nbsp;an
abstract task or idea and materializing it in the form of useful&nbsp;software.</strong></p>

<p>The possibilities are&nbsp;boundless.</p>
