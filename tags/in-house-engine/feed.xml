      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago, I had to debug a strange performance issue in an in-house engine I&#xA;was using, and I was quite surprised when I discovered the cause. The tl;dr is&#xA;that it involved some unexpected but innocuous-seeming NaNs that ended up&#xA;tanking the performance, and not just from the fact that&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2012/05/20/thats-not-normalthe-performance-of-odd-floats/&#34;&gt;operations involving NaNs are much slower than finite floats&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;on some architectures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Story time!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The code in question was part of the movement / interaction system, and involved&#xA;performing a few raycasts against the collision system to find a reference point&#xA;for movement. There would be some noticable hitches / frame hiccups when this&#xA;system was active, but it was relatively new code (in a relatively new codebase)&#xA;so bugs and unoptimized code paths were not unexpected. In particular, I thought&#xA;that this may have just been due to the raycast collision code itself &amp;ndash; at the&#xA;time, raycast acceleration had not been implemented yet, meaning we&amp;rsquo;d have to do&#xA;a naive per-triangle intersection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
